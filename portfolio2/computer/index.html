<div class="text1">Obsession<br>
2019
</div>
<div class="par1">The inspiration behind this video I created is based on an obsession of Mario Odyssey. For quite some time, I was once completely obsessed with playing the video game. When I would play, all of my attention goes into the game; sometimes I won’t be able to hear people talk to me. I want to visualize the black hole that I would fall into when playing this game and how something such as a game can completely possess all thoughts.</div>

<div class="text2">Self Portrait<br>
2019
</div>
<div class="par2">The self portrait that I created is centralized by my habit of dissociating while doing everyday things. Dissociating to me affects me in three main ways: my thoughts go empty, I sometimes forget to breathe, and the sensation of walking leaves me. This is unfortunately an unconscious habit I have, so most of the time I am unaware of the confusion I have in my face when I go into one of my trances. In an attempt, I tried to capture this look by recording myself.</div>

<div class="text3">You Video<br>
2019
</div>
<div class="par3">This video coincides with a book that I created titled “You”. The concept behind this piece is a society centered around the concept of one collective identity. I tried to limit the amount of common identifiers shown, such as eyes and fingerprints, in order to visualize an unidentifiable figure. Footage displaying ideas of DNA such as microbes and brain scans are overlaid on top to juxtapose the idea of being a collective.  </div>
