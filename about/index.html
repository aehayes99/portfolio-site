      My name is Ashley Hayes and am I currently a Graphic Design student at VCUArts in Richmond, VA. I draw a lot of inspiration from technology and gothic design and tend to incorporate the two with surreal colors, which are an homage to the vivid colors used in video games from the 90’s to early 2000’s, and gothic black letter typography. There is a fine line in pixelated art and complete chaos, I find experimentation to be the most interesting part in the process.

      I design for the purpose of giving the viewer nostalgia when viewing my work. In this day in age, the way that old technology physically looks and the pixelated content it produces is being forgotten by the emerging generation as our technology is steadily improving. I want to keep that same joy alive that I, like many others, had as kids seeing an 8bit video game.
